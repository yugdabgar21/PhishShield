Thank you for your interest in PhishShield Lite!

## 👨‍💻 Current Status

Right now, I (MASTERxD / Yug Dabgar) am the sole developer working on this project as part of my learning journey in cybersecurity and automation.

**However**, I'm open to collaboration and would love help from the community!

## 📝 Code Guidelines  
To keep things clean and maintainable:

* ✅ Follow **PEP 8** style for Python code  
* ✅ Add comments to explain complex logic  
* ✅ Keep functions small and focused  
* ✅ Update `README.md` if you add new features  
* ✅ Test locally before submitting a PR  
* ✅ Never commit API keys or secrets

## 🎓 Why I Built This
This project began as:

* A hands-on way to learn **n8n** automation  
* Practice working with **security APIs**  
* Build something **useful** for students & colleges on a **zero budget**  
* Create a **portfolio piece** for internships  

> If you're a student too, fork it and make your own version!
